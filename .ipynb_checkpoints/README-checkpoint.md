# HOW TO MACHINE LEARNING

The aim of this repository is for me to learn the basics of image recognition using machine learning tools in python.
This is done following an online tutorial. 

Upon successful completion I will be attempting a project of my own which will (hopefully) end in me building a complete full-stack product.

## Technologies Used:

- Python
- SKLearn
- PIL
- Matplotlib

### Why am I doing this as an 'aspiring web developer'?

Simple, I like to learn. The more varied my tools become the more flexible I can be. Being knowledgable is both an ego boost and a way for me to experience new paths in software engineering.
